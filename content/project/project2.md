# Rust CLI Tool

A comprehensive command-line interface tool designed to streamline developer workflows. Built with Rust for maximum performance and cross-platform compatibility.

## Overview

This CLI tool provides a suite of utilities commonly needed in software development, packaged into a single, fast, and reliable executable.

## Key Features

- **File Processing**: Batch operations on files and directories
- **Git Integration**: Enhanced git workflow commands
- **Project Templates**: Quick project scaffolding
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in benchmarking and profiling
- **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration system

## Technical Highlights

### Performance
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Leverages Rust's performance characteristics
- **Parallel processing**: Utilizes multi-core systems effectively
- **Memory safety**: No runtime errors or memory leaks
- **Fast startup**: Optimized for quick command execution

### Cross-Platform
- **Windows**: Native Windows support with PowerShell integration
- **macOS**: Homebrew compatible with shell completions
- **Linux**: Available for all major distributions

## Installation

```bash
# From source
cargo install rust-cli-tool

# From releases
curl -sSL https://install.example.com | sh
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Project scaffolding
rust-cli-tool new --template react-ts my-app

# File operations
rust-cli-tool files --find "*.rs" --replace "old_pattern" "new_pattern"

# Git helpers
rust-cli-tool git --interactive-rebase --smart-commit
```

## Architecture

The tool is built with a modular architecture:

1. **Core Engine**: Central command dispatcher and configuration manager
2. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom commands
3. **Utility Modules**: Specialized modules for different workflows
4. **Integration Layer**: APIs for external tool integration

This design ensures maintainability while providing powerful functionality for developers.
