# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample blog post to test the blog functionality of the portfolio website.

## Content Management

The blog uses markdown files with YAML frontmatter for metadata. This allows for:

- Easy content creation
- Metadata management
- Dynamic rendering
- SEO optimization

## Workflow

1. Create markdown files in the `content/blog/` directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter for metadata
3. Content is automatically available via the API
4. Cards are generated dynamically from the content

This demonstrates the full content management system in action.
